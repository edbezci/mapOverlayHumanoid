## Line Intersect Detections, v.00001

This tool is a Grapgical User Interface developed in Python to compare the 
the efficiency three widely used algorithms, Brute Force, Bentley-Ottmann Algorithm, and Shamos-Hoey Algorithms for interaction detections.

This line intersects are determined by using the Cramer's Rule, and a comparison is done via randomly generated lines, and intersects over the plane.

Such an approach is important for the Cybernetics, particularly for map-overlay, and humanoid autonomous robot movement problems.
